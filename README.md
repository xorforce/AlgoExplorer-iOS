# AlgoExplorer-iOS
A simple, user friendly application created with respect to students who want to learn and master algorithms. Made in Swift.<br><br>
This is the iOS version of the app, originally inspired from [Algo-Explorer by Amanjeet Singh](https://github.com/amanjeetsingh150/Algo-Explorer)

## List of Algorithms Available Currently:<br>
1. Sorting - Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Heap Sort, Insertion Sort, Selection Sort
2. Searching - Linear and Binary Search
3. Dynamic Programming - 0-1 Knapsack, Matrix Chain Multiplication, Longest Common Subsequence, Binomial Coefficient
4. Graphs - Floyd-Warshall Algorithm, Dijsktra's Algorithm

## To-Do
1. Handle small bugs appropriately.
2. Due to the lack of a proper REST-based Service, all data is currently local.

### I downloaded the project, what now?
1. Go to the file directory and do a ```pod install```. You must have Cocoapods installed on your system. For more information on Cocoapods, visit [here](https://cocoapods.org/).
2. Open ```AlgoExplorer.xcworkspace```
3. Build and Run the project !

### Requirements
1. Swift 3.0
2. Xcode 8.0+
3. Cocoapods 1.2.0 (Beta), should work with the stable release as well, although not tested.
